## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up your local development environment.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ananthpai1998/codechat.git
cd codechat
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
pnpm install
```

### 3. Supabase Setup

You'll need your own Supabase project for local development.

#### Create a Supabase Project

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create a new project
2. Wait for your project to be provisioned (~2 minutes)
3. Copy your project credentials from **Project Settings** → **API**:
   - Project URL
   - Anon Key (public)
   - Service Role Key (secret, for server-side operations)

#### Configure Authentication Providers

In your Supabase Dashboard:

**Email Provider (Required):**
- Navigate to **Authentication** → **Providers**
- Enable **Email** provider
- Set **Site URL**: `http://localhost:3000`
- Add **Redirect URLs**: `http://localhost:3000/**`

**GitHub OAuth (Optional):**
- See detailed instructions in [docs/settings-and-verification.md](./docs/settings-and-verification.md#github-oauth-setup)

For complete Supabase setup details, see [docs/database-design.md](./docs/database-design.md#supabase-setup).

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root by copying `.env.example`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Update the values with your Supabase credentials:

```env
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://[YOUR-PROJECT].supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[YOUR-ANON-KEY]
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=[YOUR-SERVICE-ROLE-KEY]

# Database Connection (for migrations)
POSTGRES_URL=postgresql://postgres:[PASSWORD]@db.[PROJECT].supabase.co:5432/postgres

# Application
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

**Important:** Never commit `.env.local` to version control. It's already in `.gitignore`.

For detailed environment variable documentation, see [docs/database-design.md](./docs/database-design.md#environment-variables).

### 5. Database Setup

Run the following commands to set up your database schema:

```bash
# Reset the database (drops all tables - use for fresh start)
npm run db:reset

# Apply all migrations (creates tables, indexes, RLS policies, seed data)
npm run db:migrate

# Verify the database setup
npm run db:verify
```

**What these commands do:**
- `db:reset` - Drops all existing tables and starts fresh
- `db:migrate` - Applies all migration files from `lib/db/migrations/`
- `db:verify` - Runs verification queries to ensure everything is set up correctly

For complete database schema documentation, see [docs/database-design.md](./docs/database-design.md).

### 6. Create an Admin User

To access the admin panel, you need to grant yourself admin privileges:

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Register a new account at `http://localhost:3000/register`

3. Go to your Supabase Dashboard → **Authentication** → **Users**

4. Find your newly created user and click the **Edit** icon

5. Update the `raw_user_meta_data` field to include admin role:
   ```json
   {
     "role": "admin",
     "isActive": true
   }
   ```

6. Save the changes

7. Refresh your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/admin`

For detailed admin panel documentation, see [docs/admin-panel.md](./docs/admin-panel.md).

### 7. Start Development

Your development environment is now ready!

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see your application running.

## Development Workflow

### Making Changes

1. **Create a new branch** from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following our [code standards](#code-standards)

3. **Test your changes** thoroughly:
   - Run unit tests
   - Run integration tests
   - Test manually in the browser
   - Test on different screen sizes (if UI changes)

4. **Commit your changes** with clear, descriptive commit messages:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add new feature description"
   ```

### Database Migrations

If your changes require database schema modifications:

1. **Update the Drizzle schema** in `lib/db/drizzle-schema.ts`

2. **Generate a migration file:**
   ```bash
   npm run db:generate
   ```

3. **Review the generated migration** in `lib/db/migrations/`

4. **Test the migration** on your local database:
   ```bash
   npm run db:migrate
   npm run db:verify
   ```

5. **Create a rollback script** (optional but recommended for complex migrations)

For detailed migration strategy, see [docs/database-design.md](./docs/database-design.md#migrations).

## Testing

We maintain comprehensive test coverage across unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all unit tests
npm run test:unit

# Run integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Run end-to-end tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run all tests
npm run test:all

# Run tests in watch mode (for active development)
npm run test:watch

# Generate coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

### Writing Tests

When adding new features or fixing bugs, always include tests:

- **Unit tests** for individual functions and components
- **Integration tests** for API routes and database operations
- **E2E tests** for complete user flows

**Test file locations:**
- Unit tests: `tests/unit/`
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/`
- E2E tests: `tests/e2e/`

For comprehensive testing documentation, see:
- [docs/testing.md](./docs/testing.md) - Testing overview and best practices
- [TESTING_STRATEGY.md](./TESTING_STRATEGY.md) - Detailed testing strategy
- [docs/comprehensive-testing-structure.md](./docs/comprehensive-testing-structure.md) - Complete test structure

### Ensuring Tests Pass

**Before submitting a PR, ensure:**

1. All existing tests pass:
   ```bash
   npm run test:all
   ```

2. New tests are added for your changes

3. Test coverage hasn't decreased (check with `npm run test:coverage`)

4. No linting errors:
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```

---

## Building

Before submitting your PR, verify that the production build works:

```bash
npm run build
```

**Fix all build errors** before submitting. Common issues:

- **TypeScript errors**: Fix type issues in your code
- **Linting errors**: Run `npm run lint --fix` to auto-fix
- **Missing dependencies**: Ensure all imports are correct
- **Environment variables**: Check that all required env vars are documented

If the build succeeds, you'll see:

```
✓ Compiled successfully
```

Test the production build locally:

```bash
npm run start
```

## Code Standards

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Avoid `any` types - prefer `unknown` or specific types
- Define interfaces for complex objects
- Use type guards for runtime type checking

### React/Next.js

- Use React Server Components where possible
- Follow Next.js 15 App Router conventions
- Use `'use client'` directive only when necessary
- Implement proper error boundaries

### Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Follow existing component patterns
- Use shadcn/ui components where available
- Ensure responsive design (mobile-first)

### Database

- Always use Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Add indexes for foreign keys and frequently queried columns
- Include verification queries in migration files
- Document schema changes in migrations

### Security

- Never expose service role keys client-side
- Validate all user inputs
- Use parameterized queries (Drizzle handles this)
- Follow OWASP security best practices
- Test RLS policies thoroughly

### Code Quality

- Run `npm run lint` before committing
- Write self-documenting code with clear variable names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused
- Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
